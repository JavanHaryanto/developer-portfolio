# Description of portfolio website

## Purpose
The purpose of my developer portfolio is to help me form a strong online presence. Where potential clients and future employers can, learn more about me, view any previous work I have done and most importantly get in contact with me regarding any potential partnerships.  
<br>

## Functionality/Features
### Design
My portfolio is based on the idea that all the information regarding myself and my work is easy to find and understand. I have taken the minimalism approach, using a basic contrasting colour scheme, a maximum of 3 fonts and not adding elements or animations that don't serve a purpose.
<br>

### Call to Action
As mentioned previously, the purpose of the portfolio is to attract employers and potential new clients. Which is why I have included a "Call to Action" on all my pages, located above the footer and more importantly on the "landing page". This allows people to "Get in Touch" with me with ease.
<br>

### Services
I have included a services page, to allow my target audience to identify exactly what it is I have to offer and my strengths. I believe potential clients will view this as a way to see if I am someone they can work with and potentially hire.
<br>

### Social Media
In the footer of my portfolio, I have social icons and links to my main social accounts (Linkedin, Twitter, Facebook, Github). With the portfolio being more of a place to showcase my work, including links to my social media, enables my audience to get to know me on an even more personal level and take a closer look into how I interact with the community and how I contribute as a developer in the tech community.
<br>

### CV and Hire me
On the landing page and about me page, I have incorporated a button where people can download my resume easily.
Enabling my audience to quickly get a look into my past work and if I'm a good fit for what them.
